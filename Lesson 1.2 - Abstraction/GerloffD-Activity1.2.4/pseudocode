Set num_walls to desired number of spiral walls
Set path_width to desired distance between walls
Set wall_color to desired turtle pen color
Set door_offset to 10
Set door_width to path_width

Create turtle
Set turtle pen color to wall_color
Set turtle speed to fastest
Set step_amount to path_width
Set loop_counter to 0

While loop_counter doesn’t equal num_walls:
    Turtle go forward door_offsets
    Lift pen up                            
    Turtle go forward door_width
    Put pen down                          
    Turtle go forward (step_amount - door_offset - door_width)
    Turtle turn right 90 degrees
    Increase step_amount by path_width
    Increase loop_counter by 1
